# ValorantTextChanger
Lil executable made in C# made to have different Voice language and Text language for Valorant

## First, the language of your game will be the language of your voicelines, audio callout, etc.
So if you select in your Riot Launcher the language Japanese (for exemple)
All voices will be Japanese, and (normally) your game too, but
